Hey look buddy, I'm a **software engineer**. And I solve problems.

Not problems like "*is Moore's law still relevant*", because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of Computer Architecture.

I solve practical problems.

For instance...

- I'm currently working on several projects, including but not limited to:
  - [varargparse-mk-ii-kt](https://github.com/Vad1mChK/varargparse-mk-ii-kt) -- A Kotlin Telegram bot implemented using a library
- I have successfully implemented:
  - Gameplay logic and design for [LogicNovelMystery](https://github.com/Vad1mChK/LogicNovelMystery) -- Visual novel teaching Prolog
  - Frontend teamlead's right-hand man, responsible for authentication and home screens, utilizing Jetpack Compose for visuals and navigation to deliver seamless and convenient user experiences in [BARSHunters'](https://github.com/BARSHunters) [mobile health app](https://github.com/BARSHunters/happ-frontend).
- Ask me about:
  - ...why I don't stop monitoring the Kotlin issue [KT-1440](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-1440).
    - Adding bitwise operators to Kotlin would enable more expressive and intuitive operations, significantly enhancing ease of use and migration from other languages.
      ```kotlin
      val a = 0b00001111
      val b = 0b00110011
      val c = 0b01010101

      println((~a & c) | (a & b))  // 0b01010011
      ``` 
- How to reach me:
  - [Telegram](https://t.me/Varargparse) 
- Pronouns: `he`/`him`
- Fun fact:
  - In Kotlin you can declare an `infix operator fun` without issues:
    ```kotlin
    infix operator fun String.minus(other: String) = removeSurrounding(prefix = "", suffix=other)

    fun main() {
        println("sandwich".minus("wich"))
        println("sandwich" minus "wich")
        println("sandwich" - "wich")
    }
    ```
    That was technically a "`fun`" fact, yeah.
