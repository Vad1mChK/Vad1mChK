Hey look buddy, I'm a **software engineer**. And I solve problems.

Not problems like "*is Moore's law still relevant*", because that would fall into the purview of your conundrums of Computer Architecture.

I solve practical problems.

- I'm currently working on several projects, including but not limited to:
  - [varargparse-mk-ii-kt](https://github.com/Vad1mChK/varargparse-mk-ii-kt) -- A Kotlin Telegram bot implemented using a library
- I have successfully implemented:
  - Gameplay logic and design for [LogicNovelMystery](https://github.com/Vad1mChK/LogicNovelMystery) -- Visual novel teaching Prolog
- Ask me about:
  - ...why I don't stop monitoring the Kotlin issue [KT-1440](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-1440).
    - Really, that would've looked amazing:
      ```kotlin
      val a = 0b00001111
      val b = 0b00110011
      val c = 0b01010101

      println((~a & c) | (a & b))  // 0b01010011
      ``` 
- How to reach me:
  - [Telegram](https://t.me/Varargparse) 
- Pronouns: `he`/`him`
